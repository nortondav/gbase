Git Test Project

Simple Web page containing basic git commands 

This little project is just me playing around with GIT for the first time. Its made up of a single webpage and a couple of directories for test purposes. 

The web page itself just has a list of some of the basic GIT commands in case I need to refer back to them later on.
